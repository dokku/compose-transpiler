# Dokkupose

Simple _docker-compose.yml_ to _dokku commands_ web utility written with Vue.js.

Integrated in the application editor for dokku snippets you can find a super simple tokenizer for Monaco (Visual Studio Code editor) that supports first-level auto-completion and syntax highlight for dokku commands.
